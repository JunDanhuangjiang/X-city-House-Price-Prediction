There are 3 classes which has size 57479, 2967, 2270 respectively.
Please load the dataset "class1","class2" and "class3" first, and name them "c1""c2" and "c3".

From the 1-st line to 197-th line is about how I process the data and generating the 3 classes.
Test the model please start from line 197, "Fitting Regression Trees". From line 197 to line 301
is all about fitting model based on CLASS1. Because some problem of my laptop, I have to seperate 
the CLASS1 Train and Test set into half for training the randomforest model, other model like 
boosting or baggaing you can just use Train and Test set.

Test CLASS2 please go to line 387 to line 475. It is exactly same code as above, just using Train 
and Test set from CLASS2.

Test CLASS3 please go to line 561 to line 650. It is exactly same code as above, just using Train 
and Test set from CLASS3.
